# PhoneBook_PURE_C

### this is the first ever proper project I did during my freshman year in my University:

It is a contact list which has CRUD operations using cases. It was developed in C, on of the my first langugaes I learnt. Just open main.c and run the program in codeblocks.

## this was done back in 2020 when vibe coding didnt exist much.
